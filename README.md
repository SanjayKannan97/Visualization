# Visualization
In this project, a static sales report has been transformed into a Dynamic Data visualization.
Data visualization gives us a clear idea of what the information means by giving it visual context through maps or graphs. This makes the data more natural for the human mind to comprehend and therefore makes it easier to identify trends, patterns, and outliers within large data sets

In the dashboard, I have created Sales KPIs against budget (Key Performance Indicator), and it is just a set of metrics that businesses use to measure their performance against objectives and the overall health of their business.

I used KPI on the dashboard to ensure that we are moving in the right direction, Also to measure our analytics progress through data-driven support. . I have created other few graphs and a map to indicate sales progress against various categories which will help to make decisions. Making decisions with data is rooted in meaningful, and accurate metrics that are relevant for each business.

To create this dashboard we collect the data from Adventureworks.com and stored the data in SQL Server Management Studio, Also cleaned the data with help of SQL queries. After creating the required dimension tables and Fact tables, Uploaded the cleansed data into PowerBI and developed a data model. Now the Data is ready for making the Dashboard
